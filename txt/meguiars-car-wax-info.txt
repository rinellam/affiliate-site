Meguiar's G18220 Ultimate Liquid Wax, 20 oz 

Meguiar's Ultimate Liquid Wax uses Meguiar's Thin Film technology to deliver our easiest application and removal, even if you have to wax your car in full sun! Meguiar's proprietary Hydrophobic Polymer Technology increases surface tension so water beads and rolls right off. We've re-set the bar for car wax with a pure synthetic wax that provides extended protection with amplified reflectivity that won't leave a white residue on trim and plastic.
